Table: Overview of explorable explanations. {#tbl:apps}

In crafting the "explorable explanations" [@victor_explorable_2011] in Table @tbl:apps, we draw analogies to micro-apps  [@bridgwater_what_2015] or mini-games [@dellafave_designing_2014] in which the user encounters a series of small experiences that, each with distinct interaction and objectives, can only provide minimal instruction [@brown_100_2024]. As these visualizations cannot take advantage of design techniques like Hayashida-style tutorials [@pottinger_pyafscgaporg_2023], they rely on simple "loops" [@brazie_designing_2024] for immediate "juxtaposition gratification" (JG) [@jm8_secret_2024], showing fast progression after minimal input.

Following @unwin_why_2020, our custom tools first serve as internal "exploratory" graphics enabling the insights detailed in our results with Table @tbl:insights outlining specific observations we attribute to our use of these tools.

| Distributional  | Dichotomy of larger changes to insurer-relevant tails contrasting smaller changes to mean yield.                                         |
| Claims          | Issues of using average for $y_{expected}$ [@fcic_common_2020].                                                                                                         |
| Neighborhood    | Eastward bias of impact. Model output relationships with broader climate factors, highlighting the possible systemic protective value of increased precipitation. |
| Hyper-parameter | Model resilience to removing individual inputs.                                                                                         |

Table: Observations we made from our own tools in the "exploratory" graphic context of @unwin_why_2020. {#tbl:insights}

Then, continuing to "presentation" [@unwin_why_2020], we next release these tools into a open source website at [https://ag-adaptation-study.pub](https://ag-adaptation-study.pub).

![Example interactive showing how a high stability unit could see a claim for a bad year under $l_{\sigma}$ but not $l_{\%}$.](./img/yield_sim.png "Example interactive showing how a high stability unit could see a claim for a bad year under $l_{\sigma}$ but not $l_{\%}$."){ width=90% #fig:stdev}

These public interactive visualizations like Figure @fig:stdev allow for further exploration of our modeling such as different loss thresholds for other insurance products, finding relationships of outcomes to different climate variables, answering geographically specific questions beyond the scope of this study, and modification of machine learning parameters to understand performance. This may include use as workshop activity and we also report^[We collect information about the tool only and not generalizable knowledge about users or these patterns, falling under "quality assurance" activity. IRB questionnaire on file.] briefly on design changes made to our interactive tools in response to its participation in a 9 person "real-world" workshop session co-exploring these results:

 - Facilitators elected to alternate between presentation and interaction similar to @pottinger_combining_2023 but we added the rates simulator to further improve presentation of the rate setting process.
 - Facilitators suggest that single loop [@brazie_designing_2024] designs perform best within the limited time of the workshop and we now let facilitators hold the longer two loop neighborhood simulator till the end by default.
 - As expected by the JG design [@jm8_secret_2024], discussion contrasts different results sets and configurations of models but meta-parameter visualization relies heavily on memory so we now offer a "sweep" button for facilitators to show all results at once.

Later work may further explore this design space through controlled experimentation [@lewis_using_1982] or diary studies [@shneiderman_strategies_2006].
