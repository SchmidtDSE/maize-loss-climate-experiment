            Accurate estimation of crop yield predictions is of great importance for food security under the impact of climate change. We propose a data-driven crop model that combines the knowledge advantage of process-based modeling and the computational advantage of data-driven modeling. The proposed model tracks the daily biomass accumulation process during the maize growing season and uses daily produced biomass to estimate the final grain yield. Computational studies using crop yield, field location, genotype and corresponding environmental data were conducted in the {US} Corn Belt region from 1981 to 2020. The results suggest that the proposed model can achieve an accurate prediction performance with a 7.16\% relative root-mean-square-error of average yield in 2020 and provide scientifically explainable results. The model also demonstrates its ability to detect and separate interactions between genotypic parameters and environmental variables. Additionally, this study demonstrates the potential value of the proposed model in helping farmers achieve higher yields by optimizing seed selection.},

            Cover crops are gaining traction in many agricultural regions, partly driven by increased public subsidies and by private markets for ecosystem services. These payments are motivated by environmental benefits, including improved soil health, reduced erosion, and increased soil organic carbon. However, previous work based on experimental plots or crop modeling indicates cover crops may reduce crop yields. It remains unclear, though, how recent cover crop adoption has affected productivity in commercial agricultural systems. Here we perform the first large‐scale, field‐level analysis of observed yield impacts from cover cropping as implemented across the {US} Corn Belt. We use validated satellite data products at sub‐field scales to analyze maize and soybean yield outcomes for over 90,000 fields in 2019–2020. Because we lack data on cover crop species or timing, we seek to quantify the yield impacts of cover cropping as currently practiced in aggregate. Using causal forests analysis, we estimate an average maize yield loss of 5.5\% on fields where cover crops were used for 3 or more years, compared with fields that did not adopt cover cropping. Maize yield losses were larger on fields with better soil ratings, cooler mid‐season temperatures, and lower spring rainfall. For soybeans, average yield losses were 3.5\%, with larger impacts on fields with warmer June temperatures, lower spring and late‐season rainfall, and, to a lesser extent, better soils. Estimated impacts are consistent with multiple mechanisms indicated by experimental and simulation‐based studies, including the effects of cover crops on nitrogen dynamics, water consumption, and soil oxygen depletion. Our results suggest a need to improve cover crop management to reduce yield penalties, and a potential need to target subsidies based on likely yield impacts. Ultimately, avoiding substantial yield penalties is important for realizing widespread adoption and associated benefits for water quality, erosion, soil carbon, and greenhouse gas emissions.},

            This study investigates whether cover crop adoption reduces extreme‐weather‐related crop insurance losses. To achieve this objective, we utilize a county‐level panel data set with information on cover crop adoption acres, crop insurance losses (i.e., specifically due to drought, excess heat, or excess moisture), and a number of weather variables. The data cover the main row crop production region in the Midwestern United States ({US}) for the period 2005 to 2018. We utilize linear fixed effects econometric models and a number of robustness checks in the empirical analysis (i.e., a fractional regression approach, two “external‐instrument‐free” estimation procedures, and a variety of alternative empirical specifications). The estimation methods used take advantage of the panel nature of the data to address various specification and endogeneity issues. We find evidence that counties with higher cover crop adoption tend to have lower crop insurance losses due to drought, excess heat, or excess moisture. Our analysis also indicates that cover crops likely have stronger loss mitigation effects against excess moisture events (like floods) and somewhat weaker loss mitigation impacts against droughts and excess heat. Nonetheless, our results overall suggest that cover crops can enhance resilience to extreme weather events and have the potential to be an effective climate change adaptation strategy in {US} agriculture.},

            Climate change adaptation requires building agricultural system resilience to warmer, drier climates. Increasing temporal plant diversity through crop rotation diversification increases yields of some crops under drought, but its potential to enhance crop drought resistance and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We conducted a drought manipulation experiment using rainout shelters embedded within a 36-year crop rotation diversity and no-till experiment in a temperate climate and measured a suite of soil and crop developmental and eco-physiological traits in the field and laboratory. We show that diversifying maize-soybean rotations with small grain cereals and cover crops mitigated maize water stress at the leaf and canopy scales and reduced yield losses to drought by 17.1 ± 6.1\%, while no-till did not affect maize drought resistance. Path analysis showed a strong correlation between soil organic matter and lower maize water stress despite no significant differences in soil organic matter between rotations or tillage treatments. This positive relationship between soil organic matter and maize water status was not mediated by higher soil water retention or infiltration as often hypothesized, nor differential depth of root water uptake as measured with stable isotopes, suggesting that other mechanisms are at play. Crop rotation diversification is an underappreciated drought management tool to adapt crop production to climate change through managing for soil organic matter.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Agricultural monitoring, seasonal crop forecasting and climate change adaptation planning all require identifying where, when, how and which crops are grown. Global gridded cropping system data products offer useful information for these applications. However, not only the main sources of information (satellites, censuses, surveys and models) but also the spatial and temporal resolutions of these data products are quite distant from each other because of different user requirements. This is a barrier to strengthening collaborations among the research communities working to increase the capacity of societies to manage climate risks for global food systems, from extreme weather disasters to climate change. A first step is to improve cropping system data products so they can be used more seamlessly across various applications than they are currently. Toward this goal, this article reviews global gridded data products of crop variables (area, yield, cropping intensity, etc) using systematic literature survey, identifies their current limitations, and suggests directions for future research. We found that cropland or crop type mapping and yield or production estimation/prediction together accounted for half of the research objectives of the reviewed studies. Satellite-based data products are dominant at the finer resolution in space and time ({\textless}10 km and daily to annual), while model-based data products are found at the coarser resolutions ({\textgreater}55 km and ⩾decadal). Census-based data products are seen at intermediate resolutions (10–55 km and annual to decadal). The suggested directions for future research include the hybridization of multiple sources of information, improvements to temporal coverage and resolution, the enrichment of management variables, the exploration of new sources of information, and comprehensiveness within a single data product.},

              Quantification of the sector-specific financial impacts of historical global warming represents a critical gap in climate change impacts assessment. The multiple decades of county-level data available from the U.S. crop insurance program—which collectively represent aggregate damages to the agricultural sector largely borne by U.S. taxpayers—present a unique opportunity to close this gap. Using econometric analysis in combination with observed and simulated changes in county-level temperature, we show that global warming has already contributed substantially to rising crop insurance losses in the U.S. For example, we estimate that county-level temperature trends have contributed \${US}

              27.0 billion—or 19\%—of the national-level crop insurance losses over the 1991–2017 period. Further, we estimate that observed warming contributed almost half of total losses in the most costly single year (2012). In addition, analyses of a large suite of global climate model simulations yield very high confidence that anthropogenic climate forcing has increased U.S. crop insurance losses. These sector-specific estimates provide important quantitative information about the financial costs of the global warming that has already occurred (including the costs of individual extreme events), as well as the economic value of mitigation and/or adaptation options.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Concerns over climate change are motivated in large part because of their impact on human society. Assessing the effect of that uncertainty on specific potential impacts is demanding, since it requires a systematic survey over both climate and impacts models. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainty in projected crop yields for maize, spring and winter wheat, rice, and soybean, using a suite of nine crop models and up to 45 {CMIP}5 and 34 {CMIP}6 climate projections for three different forcing scenarios. To make this task computationally tractable, we use a new set of statistical crop model emulators. We find that climate and crop models contribute about equally to overall uncertainty. While the ranges of yield uncertainties under {CMIP}5 and {CMIP}6 projections are similar, median impact in aggregate total caloric production is typically more negative for the {CMIP}6 projections (+1\% to −19\%) than for {CMIP}5 (+5\% to −13\%). In the first half of the 21st century and for individual crops is the spread across crop models typically wider than that across climate models, but we find distinct differences between crops: globally, wheat and maize uncertainties are dominated by the crop models, but soybean and rice are more sensitive to the climate projections. Climate models with very similar global mean warming can lead to very different aggregate impacts so that climate model uncertainties remain a significant contributor to agricultural impacts uncertainty. These results show the utility of large-ensemble methods that allow comprehensively evaluating factors affecting crop yields or other impacts under climate change. The crop model ensemble used here is unbalanced and pulls the assumption that all projections are equally plausible into question. Better methods for consistent model testing, also at the level of individual processes, will have to be developed and applied by the crop modeling community.},

            Pervious assessments of crop yield response to climate change are mainly aided with either process-based models or statistical models, with a focus on predicting the changes in average yields, whilst there is growing interest in yield variability and extremes. In this study, we simulate {US} maize yield using process-based models, traditional regression model and a machine-learning algorithm, and importantly, identify the weakness and strength of each method in simulating the average, variability and extremes of maize yield across the country. We show that both regression and machine learning models can well reproduce the observed pattern of yield averages, while large bias is found for process-based crop models even fed with harmonized parameters. As for the probability distribution of yields, machine learning shows the best skill, followed by regression model and process-based models. For the country as a whole, machine learning can explain 93\% of observed yield variability, followed by regression model (51\%) and process-based models (42\%). Based on the improved capability of the machine learning algorithm, we estimate that {US} maize yield is projected to decrease by 13.5\% under the 2 °C global warming scenario (by ∼2050 s). Yields less than or equal to the 10th percentile in the yield distribution for the baseline period are predicted to occur in 19\% and 25\% of years in 1.5 °C (by ∼2040 s) and 2 °C global warming scenarios, with potentially significant implications for food supply, prices and trade. The machine learning and regression methods are computationally much more efficient than process-based models, making it feasible to do probabilistic risk analysis of climate impacts on crop production for a wide range of future scenarios.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Extreme events can lead to crop yield declines, resulting in financial losses and threats to food security, and the frequency and intensity of such events is projected to increase. As global gridded crop models ({GGCMs}) are commonly used to assess climate change impacts on agricultural yields, there is a need to understand whether these models are able to reproduce the observed yield declines. We evaluated 13 {GGCMs} from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project and compared observed and simulated impact of past droughts and heatwaves on yields for four crops (maize, rice, soy, wheat). We found that most models detect but underestimate the impact of droughts and heatwaves on yield. Specifically, the drought signal was detected by 12 of 13 models for maize and all models for wheat, while the heat signal was detected by eleven models for maize and six models for wheat. To investigate whether the difference between simulated and observed yield declines is due to a misrepresentation of simulated exposure to heat or water scarcity (i.e. misrepresentation of growing season), we analysed the relationship between average discrepancies between observed and simulated yield losses, and average simulated exposure to extreme weather conditions across all crop models. We found a positive correlation between simulated exposure to heat and model performance for heatwaves, but found no correlation for droughts. This suggests that there is a systematic underestimation of yield responses to heat and drought and not only a misrepresentation of exposure. Assuming that performance for the past indicates models’ capacity to project future yield impacts, models likely underestimate future yield decline from climate change. High-quality temporally and spatially resolved observational data on growing seasons will be highly valuable to further improve crop models’ capacity to adequately respond to extreme weather events.},

            Many studies have examined the role of mean climate change in agriculture, but an understanding of the influence of inter-annual climate variations on crop yields in different regions remains elusive. We use detailed crop statistics time series for {\textasciitilde}13,500 political units to examine how recent climate variability led to variations in maize, rice, wheat and soybean crop yields worldwide. While some areas show no significant influence of climate variability, in substantial areas of the global breadbaskets, {\textgreater}60\% of the yield variability can be explained by climate variability. Globally, climate variability accounts for roughly a third ({\textasciitilde}32–39\%) of the observed yield variability. Our study uniquely illustrates spatial patterns in the relationship between climate variability and crop yield variability, highlighting where variations in temperature, precipitation or their interaction explain yield variability. We discuss key drivers for the observed variations to target further research and policy interventions geared towards buffering future crop production from climate variability.},

            Previous literature have shown that warming temperatures due to climate change are likely to decrease mean crop yields and increase crop yield risk. However, there is limited understanding of how crop insurance participation can potentially affect the adverse crop yield impacts of warming (or extreme heat). This study specifically examines whether crop insurance participation influences the impact of extreme heat on yield risk (i.e. yield variance, skewness and kurtosis). We utilise a parametric moment-based method and county-level panel data to evaluate how crop insurance participation affects the relationship between warming temperatures and the moments of crop yield distributions. Our results indicate that the yield risk increasing effect of warming is further magnified under high levels of crop insurance participation. This result still holds even when allowing for long-run adaptation (although the crop insurance effect tends to be weaker in this case). In general, our results indicate that not only does crop insurance participation adversely impact mean yields under climate change, it also influences the extent by which warming affects yield variability over time. This supports the notion that crop insurance can serve as a disincentive for climate change adaptation in agriculture.},

Regression analysis found that soil physical characteristics explained 57 to 65\% of the variation in corn and hay yields. Corn and hay yield regressions calculated from a regression data set predicted yields for crops on soils in a test data set without bias and with residual errors of 10 to 15\%. Updated crop yields under good management on more productive soils were obtained by surveying farmers and variety trials conducted in West Virginia and surrounding states. The updated yields and relative historic yields were used proportionally to update expected crop yields by soil series. The updated yields were reviewed by local conservation professionals and adjusted as needed based on local experience. These updated yields are now being used as the expected crop yield for the West Virginia soil series in the {NASIS}.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss {AdaMax}, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

            Climate change is becoming more and more remarkable which has an obvious impact on crop yields all over the world. Future climate scenario data was simulated by 5 climate models recommended by {ISI}-{MIP} under 4 {RCP} scenarios, in which the approximate scenarios with global warming by 1.5 °C and 2 °C were selected. Applying {DSSAT} and {GTAP} models, the per unit yield changes of maize in the world under global warming by 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C were analyzed and the market prices of maize at national and global levels were simulated. The results showed that, the risk of maize yield reduction under 2.0 °C scenario was much more serious than 1.5 °C scenario; the ratios of yield changes were separately 0.18\% and − 10.8\% under 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C scenarios. The reduction trend of total maize production is obvious in the top five countries and the main producing regions of the world, especially under the 2.0 °C scenario. The market price of maize would increase by around 0.7\% and 3.4\% under 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C scenarios. With the quickly increasing population in the world, it is urgent for all countries to pay enough attention to the risk of maize yield and take actions of mitigation and adaptation to climate change.},

              Episodes of severe weather in the United States, such as the present abundance of
rainfall in California, are brandished as tangible evidence of the future costs of
current climate trends. Hsiang
              et al.
              collected national data
documenting the responses in six economic sectors to short-term weather fluctuations.
These data were integrated with probabilistic distributions from a set of global climate
models and used to estimate future costs during the remainder of this century across a
range of scenarios (see the Perspective by Pizer). In terms of overall effects on gross
domestic product, the authors predict negative impacts in the southern United States and
positive impacts in some parts of the Pacific Northwest and New England.

            Estimates of climate change damage are central to the design of climate policies. Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing damages that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors—agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor—increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2\% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20\% of county income (90\% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).},

	abstract = {Climate change is affecting all regions of the world with different climates, and the scale of damage is increasing due to the occurrence of various natural disasters. In particular, maize production is highly affected by abnormal climate events such as heat waves and droughts. Increasing temperatures can accelerate growth and shorten the growing season, potentially reducing productivity. Additionally, enhanced temperatures during the ripening period can accelerate the process, reducing crop yields. In addition, drought stress due to water deficit can greatly affect seedling formation, early plant growth, photosynthesis, reproductive growth, and yield, so proper water management is critical to maize growth. Maize, in particular, is tall and broad-leaved, so extreme drought stress at planting can cause leaves to curl and stunt growth. It is important to understand that severe drought can have a detrimental effect on the growth and reproduction of maize. In addition, high temperatures caused by drought stress can inhibit the induction of flowering in male flowers and cause factors that interfere with pollen development. It is therefore important to increase the productivity of all food crops, including maize, while maintaining them in the face of persistent drought caused by climate change. This requires a strategy to develop genetically modified crops and drought-tolerant maize that can effectively respond to climate change. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of climate change and drought tolerance on maize growth. We also reviewed molecular breeding techniques to develop drought-tolerant maize varieties in response to climate change.},

A systematic literature and data review was conducted to identify major drivers for climate benefits and costs of cover crops in maize (
              Zea maize L

Carbon land benefit, the carbon opportunity costs based on maize yield gains following cover crops, is the major contributor to the {NCCMI} (34.5\% of all benefits). Carbon sequestration is the second largest contributor (33.8\%). The climate costs of cover crops are mainly dominated by emissions from their seed production and foregone benefits due to land use for cover crops seeds. However, these two costs account for only 15.8\% of the benefits. Extrapolating these results, planting cover crops before all maize acreage in the {EU} results in a climate change mitigation of 49.80 million Mg {CO}

Given the years passed since the future climate projections that served as basis for the {IPCC} 4th, 5th and 6th Assessment Reports were released, it is now possible to answer this fundamental question if the projected global warming has been over or underestimated. This study presents a comparison between {CMIP}3, {CMIP}5 and {CMIP}6 future temperature projections and observations. The results show that the global warming projected by all {CMIPs} and future climate scenarios here analyzed project a global warming slightly lower than the observed one. The observed warming is closer to the upper level of the projected ones, revealing that {CMIPs} future climate scenarios with higher {GHG} emissions appear to be the most realistic ones. These results show that {CMIPs} future warming projections have been slightly conservative up to 2020, which could suggest a similar cold bias in their warming projections up to the end of the current century. However, given the short future periods here analyzed, inferences about warming at longer timescales cannot be done with confidence, since the models internal variability can play a relevant role on timescales of 20 years and less.},

              Climate models are crucial for assessing climate variability and change. A reliable model for future climate should reasonably simulate the historical climate. Here, we assess the performance of {CMIP}6 models in reproducing statistical properties of observed annual maxima of daily precipitation. We go beyond the commonly used methods and assess {CMIP}6 simulations on three scales by performing: (a) univariate comparison based on L‐moments and relative difference measures; (b) bivariate comparison using Kernel densities of mean and L‐variation, and of L‐skewness and L‐kurtosis, and (c) comparison of the entire distribution function using the Generalized Extreme Value (
              
              ) distribution coupled with a novel application of the Anderson‐Darling Goodness‐of‐fit test. The results reveal that the statistical shape properties (related to the frequency and magnitude of extremes) of {CMIP}6 simulations match well with the observational datasets. The simulated mean and variation differ among the models with 70\% of simulations having a difference within
              
              10\% from the observations. Biases are observed in the bivariate investigation of mean and variation. Several models perform well with the {HadGEM}3‐{GC}31‐{MM} model performing well in all three scales when compared to the ground‐based Global Precipitation Climatology Centre data. Finally, the study highlights biases of {CMIP}6 models in simulating extreme precipitation in the Arctic, Tropics, arid and semi‐arid regions.

            Plain Language Summary
            Annual maxima of daily precipitation are widely used to design critical infrastructures such as dams and stormwater networks. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme events. Climate model projections offer a glimpse into the future and can help assess potential changes and impacts. It is reasonable to assume that climate models simulating accurately the historical climate may also simulate well the future. Here, we assessed the latest generation of climate models, that is the {CMIP}6 models, to reproduce the historical annual maximum daily precipitation. We compared simulations and observations of extreme precipitation using advanced summary statistics, novel probability similarity measures, and robust statistical tests. The results indicate that models, in general, reproduce well the behavior of annual maximum precipitation, but biases exist especially in the simultaneous behavior of mean and variance. Shortcomings of {CMIP}6 models are highlighted in the Arctic, Tropics, arid, and semi‐arid regions.

            Since the Agricultural Act of 2014, the federal crop insurance program ({FCIP}) has been the cornerstone agricultural policy in the United States, and is the largest such program globally, with about \$100 billion in coverage annually. Given its scale and scope, the {FCIP} has the potential to have pervasive impacts on incentives and policy functioning if not designed and priced properly. Surprisingly, soil data are not considered by the government when establishing insurance guarantees or rates. Using soil data that could easily and feasibly be scaled nationally, we find that the pricing differentials caused by the government′s failure to handle soil information leads to large errors in rating.},

            This study examines whether crop insurance participation reduces incentives to use cover crops in corn and soybean production. To achieve this objective, we utilize 2006–2015 county‐level longitudinal data with information on cover crop adoption and crop insurance participation for the State of Indiana. Cover crop adoption information is collected from a remote sensing (satellite‐based) data set of soil health practices. Linear fixed effect ({FE}) models and instrumental variable {FE} models are used in the empirical analysis to take advantage of the panel nature of the data and address potential endogeneity issues. Our results suggest that while crop insurance coverage may play a role in “disincentivizing” cover crop use, it is likely not a major driver in the cover crop adoption decision (i.e., the magnitude of the effect is small). Therefore, further research and policy attention toward other potential mechanisms that can likely have a larger impact on cover crop uptake may be a better approach (e.g., enhanced outreach programs and/or additional targeted conservation payments).},

	abstract = {Abstract
            As changing climates create drought conditions with increasing frequency and severity, there is an urgent need for farmers to adopt agricultural systems that lower the risk of losses during drought. Diverse crop rotations have long been associated with a wide array of economic and environmental benefits, yet cropping systems in the {US} Midwest and across the world have been simplifying for over a century. Long-term experiments have shown potential for diverse rotations to avoid yield losses under dry conditions, and could be an impactful target in a region overwhelmingly dominated by corn-soy rotation. Here we use Bayesian modeling to show spatial patterns of yield benefits that result from increasing rotational diversity in a range of weather conditions. Data from over 2.2 million field-years reveal that diverse rotations decrease the risk of corn yield losses in dry years in areas that experience these conditions more frequently, while simultaneously increasing yields under favorable conditions across the region. The potential for yield risk mitigation described in the current analysis underscores the critical need for crop rotation adoption as changing climates threaten yield stability in the {US} and across the globe. We highlight areas where diverse rotations are most likely to improve yields and mitigate risk, amidst spatial heterogeneity in the magnitude of these benefits.},

              Introduction
              Pesticides are increasingly used in intensely managed agro‐environments, with an increasingly acknowledged impact on crop production, root establishment and plant resilience.

              Materials and Methods
              
                In a greenhouse, we studied the effects of three mowing regimes (uncut, and cutting 5 or 15 cm) employed three times during the season on root and shoot biomass and chlorophyll content of the cool‐season grass
                Festuca pratensis
                (meadow fescue) growing in soil with a history of glyphosate‐based herbicide ({GBH}) use, the corresponding control soil, and sterilized control soil. Half of the plants hosted a systemic and vertically transmitted fungal endophyte,
                Epichloë uncinata

              Results
              Endophyte symbiosis did not affect any tested plant parameters. Cutting the plants to 5 cm decreased both root and cumulative shoot biomass. Herbicide soil history, together with intense cutting (5 cm), caused a decrease in shoot biomass and lowered the chlorophyll content. Surprisingly, soil sterilization boosted shoot biomass and chlorophyll concentrations during less intense cutting (15 cm) and noncutting when compared to the control soil. Root biomass reduced in uncut plants when growing in soil with a history of glyphosate use.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Our results indicate that {GBH} residues in the soil can diminish shoot biomass when grass is frequently cut. Decreased root biomass caused by soil glyphosate history goes together with a reduction of carbon allocation belowground, which decreases grassland resilience to climate warming, increasingly occurring droughts and extreme weather events.},

              The Climate Hazards Center Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate projection dataset ({CHC}-{CMIP}6) was developed to support the analysis of climate-related hazards, including extreme humid heat and drought conditions, over the recent past and in the near-future. Global daily high resolution (0.05°) grids of the Climate Hazards {InfraRed} Temperature with Stations temperature product, the Climate Hazards {InfraRed} Precipitation with Stations precipitation product, and {ERA}5-derived relative humidity form the basis of the 1983–2016 historical record, from which daily Vapor Pressure Deficits ({VPD}) and maximum Wet Bulb Globe Temperatures ({WBGT}

Large {CMIP}6 ensembles from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 and {SSP} 5-8.5 scenarios were then used to develop high resolution daily 2030 and 2050 ‘delta’ fields.
