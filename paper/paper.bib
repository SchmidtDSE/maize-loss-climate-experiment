	abstract = {Abstract
            Cover crops are gaining traction in many agricultural regions, partly driven by increased public subsidies and by private markets for ecosystem services. These payments are motivated by environmental benefits, including improved soil health, reduced erosion, and increased soil organic carbon. However, previous work based on experimental plots or crop modeling indicates cover crops may reduce crop yields. It remains unclear, though, how recent cover crop adoption has affected productivity in commercial agricultural systems. Here we perform the first large‐scale, field‐level analysis of observed yield impacts from cover cropping as implemented across the {US} Corn Belt. We use validated satellite data products at sub‐field scales to analyze maize and soybean yield outcomes for over 90,000 fields in 2019–2020. Because we lack data on cover crop species or timing, we seek to quantify the yield impacts of cover cropping as currently practiced in aggregate. Using causal forests analysis, we estimate an average maize yield loss of 5.5\% on fields where cover crops were used for 3 or more years, compared with fields that did not adopt cover cropping. Maize yield losses were larger on fields with better soil ratings, cooler mid‐season temperatures, and lower spring rainfall. For soybeans, average yield losses were 3.5\%, with larger impacts on fields with warmer June temperatures, lower spring and late‐season rainfall, and, to a lesser extent, better soils. Estimated impacts are consistent with multiple mechanisms indicated by experimental and simulation‐based studies, including the effects of cover crops on nitrogen dynamics, water consumption, and soil oxygen depletion. Our results suggest a need to improve cover crop management to reduce yield penalties, and a potential need to target subsidies based on likely yield impacts. Ultimately, avoiding substantial yield penalties is important for realizing widespread adoption and associated benefits for water quality, erosion, soil carbon, and greenhouse gas emissions.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Climate change adaptation requires building agricultural system resilience to warmer, drier climates. Increasing temporal plant diversity through crop rotation diversification increases yields of some crops under drought, but its potential to enhance crop drought resistance and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We conducted a drought manipulation experiment using rainout shelters embedded within a 36-year crop rotation diversity and no-till experiment in a temperate climate and measured a suite of soil and crop developmental and eco-physiological traits in the field and laboratory. We show that diversifying maize-soybean rotations with small grain cereals and cover crops mitigated maize water stress at the leaf and canopy scales and reduced yield losses to drought by 17.1 ± 6.1\%, while no-till did not affect maize drought resistance. Path analysis showed a strong correlation between soil organic matter and lower maize water stress despite no significant differences in soil organic matter between rotations or tillage treatments. This positive relationship between soil organic matter and maize water status was not mediated by higher soil water retention or infiltration as often hypothesized, nor differential depth of root water uptake as measured with stable isotopes, suggesting that other mechanisms are at play. Crop rotation diversification is an underappreciated drought management tool to adapt crop production to climate change through managing for soil organic matter.},

              Quantification of the sector-specific financial impacts of historical global warming represents a critical gap in climate change impacts assessment. The multiple decades of county-level data available from the U.S. crop insurance program—which collectively represent aggregate damages to the agricultural sector largely borne by U.S. taxpayers—present a unique opportunity to close this gap. Using econometric analysis in combination with observed and simulated changes in county-level temperature, we show that global warming has already contributed substantially to rising crop insurance losses in the U.S. For example, we estimate that county-level temperature trends have contributed \${US}

              27.0 billion—or 19\%—of the national-level crop insurance losses over the 1991–2017 period. Further, we estimate that observed warming contributed almost half of total losses in the most costly single year (2012). In addition, analyses of a large suite of global climate model simulations yield very high confidence that anthropogenic climate forcing has increased U.S. crop insurance losses. These sector-specific estimates provide important quantitative information about the financial costs of the global warming that has already occurred (including the costs of individual extreme events), as well as the economic value of mitigation and/or adaptation options.},

            Pervious assessments of crop yield response to climate change are mainly aided with either process-based models or statistical models, with a focus on predicting the changes in average yields, whilst there is growing interest in yield variability and extremes. In this study, we simulate {US} maize yield using process-based models, traditional regression model and a machine-learning algorithm, and importantly, identify the weakness and strength of each method in simulating the average, variability and extremes of maize yield across the country. We show that both regression and machine learning models can well reproduce the observed pattern of yield averages, while large bias is found for process-based crop models even fed with harmonized parameters. As for the probability distribution of yields, machine learning shows the best skill, followed by regression model and process-based models. For the country as a whole, machine learning can explain 93\% of observed yield variability, followed by regression model (51\%) and process-based models (42\%). Based on the improved capability of the machine learning algorithm, we estimate that {US} maize yield is projected to decrease by 13.5\% under the 2 °C global warming scenario (by ∼2050 s). Yields less than or equal to the 10th percentile in the yield distribution for the baseline period are predicted to occur in 19\% and 25\% of years in 1.5 °C (by ∼2040 s) and 2 °C global warming scenarios, with potentially significant implications for food supply, prices and trade. The machine learning and regression methods are computationally much more efficient than process-based models, making it feasible to do probabilistic risk analysis of climate impacts on crop production for a wide range of future scenarios.},

We use detailed crop statistics time series for {\textasciitilde}13,500 political units to examine how recent climate variability led to variations in maize, rice, wheat and soybean crop yields worldwide. While some areas show no significant influence of climate variability, in substantial areas of the global breadbaskets, {\textgreater}60\% of the yield variability can be explained by climate variability. Globally, climate variability accounts for roughly a third ({\textasciitilde}32–39\%) of the observed yield variability. Our study uniquely illustrates spatial patterns in the relationship between climate variability and crop yield variability, highlighting where variations in temperature, precipitation or their interaction explain yield variability. We discuss key drivers for the observed variations to target further research and policy interventions geared towards buffering future crop production from climate variability.},

This study specifically examines whether crop insurance participation influences the impact of extreme heat on yield risk (i.e. yield variance, skewness and kurtosis). We utilise a parametric moment-based method and county-level panel data to evaluate how crop insurance participation affects the relationship between warming temperatures and the moments of crop yield distributions. Our results indicate that the yield risk increasing effect of warming is further magnified under high levels of crop insurance participation. This result still holds even when allowing for long-run adaptation (although the crop insurance effect tends to be weaker in this case). In general, our results indicate that not only does crop insurance participation adversely impact mean yields under climate change, it also influences the extent by which warming affects yield variability over time. This supports the notion that crop insurance can serve as a disincentive for climate change adaptation in agriculture.},

The objective of this project was to compare historic expected crop yields to soil physical characteristics and to update expected yields for West Virginia soils in the United States National Soils Information System ({NASIS}). Regression analysis found that soil physical characteristics explained 57 to 65\% of the variation in corn and hay yields. Corn and hay yield regressions calculated from a regression data set predicted yields for crops on soils in a test data set without bias and with residual errors of 10 to 15\%. Updated crop yields under good management on more productive soils were obtained by surveying farmers and variety trials conducted in West Virginia and surrounding states. The updated yields and relative historic yields were used proportionally to update expected crop yields by soil series. The updated yields were reviewed by local conservation professionals and adjusted as needed based on local experience. These updated yields are now being used as the expected crop yield for the West Virginia soil series in the {NASIS}.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss {AdaMax}, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

            Climate change is becoming more and more remarkable which has an obvious impact on crop yields all over the world. Future climate scenario data was simulated by 5 climate models recommended by {ISI}-{MIP} under 4 {RCP} scenarios, in which the approximate scenarios with global warming by 1.5 °C and 2 °C were selected. Applying {DSSAT} and {GTAP} models, the per unit yield changes of maize in the world under global warming by 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C were analyzed and the market prices of maize at national and global levels were simulated. The results showed that, the risk of maize yield reduction under 2.0 °C scenario was much more serious than 1.5 °C scenario; the ratios of yield changes were separately 0.18\% and − 10.8\% under 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C scenarios. The reduction trend of total maize production is obvious in the top five countries and the main producing regions of the world, especially under the 2.0 °C scenario. The market price of maize would increase by around 0.7\% and 3.4\% under 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C scenarios. With the quickly increasing population in the world, it is urgent for all countries to pay enough attention to the risk of maize yield and take actions of mitigation and adaptation to climate change.},

              Episodes of severe weather in the United States, such as the present abundance of
rainfall in California, are brandished as tangible evidence of the future costs of
current climate trends. Hsiang
              et al.
              collected national data
documenting the responses in six economic sectors to short-term weather fluctuations.
These data were integrated with probabilistic distributions from a set of global climate
models and used to estimate future costs during the remainder of this century across a
range of scenarios (see the Perspective by Pizer). In terms of overall effects on gross
domestic product, the authors predict negative impacts in the southern United States and
positive impacts in some parts of the Pacific Northwest and New England.

            Estimates of climate change damage are central to the design of climate policies. Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing damages that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors—agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor—increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2\% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20\% of county income (90\% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).},

Carbon land benefit, the carbon opportunity costs based on maize yield gains following cover crops, is the major contributor to the {NCCMI} (34.5\% of all benefits). Carbon sequestration is the second largest contributor (33.8\%). The climate costs of cover crops are mainly dominated by emissions from their seed production and foregone benefits due to land use for cover crops seeds. However, these two costs account for only 15.8\% of the benefits. Extrapolating these results, planting cover crops before all maize acreage in the {EU} results in a climate change mitigation of 49.80 million Mg {CO}

            Since the Agricultural Act of 2014, the federal crop insurance program ({FCIP}) has been the cornerstone agricultural policy in the United States, and is the largest such program globally, with about \$100 billion in coverage annually. Given its scale and scope, the {FCIP} has the potential to have pervasive impacts on incentives and policy functioning if not designed and priced properly. Surprisingly, soil data are not considered by the government when establishing insurance guarantees or rates. Using soil data that could easily and feasibly be scaled nationally, we find that the pricing differentials caused by the government′s failure to handle soil information leads to large errors in rating.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This study examines whether crop insurance participation reduces incentives to use cover crops in corn and soybean production. To achieve this objective, we utilize 2006–2015 county‐level longitudinal data with information on cover crop adoption and crop insurance participation for the State of Indiana. Cover crop adoption information is collected from a remote sensing (satellite‐based) data set of soil health practices. Linear fixed effect ({FE}) models and instrumental variable {FE} models are used in the empirical analysis to take advantage of the panel nature of the data and address potential endogeneity issues. Our results suggest that while crop insurance coverage may play a role in “disincentivizing” cover crop use, it is likely not a major driver in the cover crop adoption decision (i.e., the magnitude of the effect is small). Therefore, further research and policy attention toward other potential mechanisms that can likely have a larger impact on cover crop uptake may be a better approach (e.g., enhanced outreach programs and/or additional targeted conservation payments).},

            As changing climates create drought conditions with increasing frequency and severity, there is an urgent need for farmers to adopt agricultural systems that lower the risk of losses during drought. Diverse crop rotations have long been associated with a wide array of economic and environmental benefits, yet cropping systems in the {US} Midwest and across the world have been simplifying for over a century. Long-term experiments have shown potential for diverse rotations to avoid yield losses under dry conditions, and could be an impactful target in a region overwhelmingly dominated by corn-soy rotation. Here we use Bayesian modeling to show spatial patterns of yield benefits that result from increasing rotational diversity in a range of weather conditions. Data from over 2.2 million field-years reveal that diverse rotations decrease the risk of corn yield losses in dry years in areas that experience these conditions more frequently, while simultaneously increasing yields under favorable conditions across the region. The potential for yield risk mitigation described in the current analysis underscores the critical need for crop rotation adoption as changing climates threaten yield stability in the {US} and across the globe. We highlight areas where diverse rotations are most likely to improve yields and mitigate risk, amidst spatial heterogeneity in the magnitude of these benefits.},

              Introduction
              Pesticides are increasingly used in intensely managed agro‐environments, with an increasingly acknowledged impact on crop production, root establishment and plant resilience. At the same time management practices are intensified with the goal to maximize productivity.
            
            
              Materials and Methods
              
                In a greenhouse, we studied the effects of three mowing regimes (uncut, and cutting 5 or 15 cm) employed three times during the season on root and shoot biomass and chlorophyll content of the cool‐season grass
                Festuca pratensis
                (meadow fescue) growing in soil with a history of glyphosate‐based herbicide ({GBH}) use, the corresponding control soil, and sterilized control soil. Half of the plants hosted a systemic and vertically transmitted fungal endophyte,
                Epichloë uncinata
                , which is known to promote host grass growth.
              
            
            
              Results
              Endophyte symbiosis did not affect any tested plant parameters. Cutting the plants to 5 cm decreased both root and cumulative shoot biomass. Herbicide soil history, together with intense cutting (5 cm), caused a decrease in shoot biomass and lowered the chlorophyll content. Surprisingly, soil sterilization boosted shoot biomass and chlorophyll concentrations during less intense cutting (15 cm) and noncutting when compared to the control soil. Root biomass reduced in uncut plants when growing in soil with a history of glyphosate use.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Our results indicate that {GBH} residues in the soil can diminish shoot biomass when grass is frequently cut. Decreased root biomass caused by soil glyphosate history goes together with a reduction of carbon allocation belowground, which decreases grassland resilience to climate warming, increasingly occurring droughts and extreme weather events.},

abstract = {Predicting the potential effects of climate change on crop yields requires a model of how crops respond to weather. As predictions from different models often disagree, understanding the sources of this divergence is central to building a more robust picture of climate change's likely impacts. A common approach is to use statistical models trained on historical yields and some simplified measurements of weather, such as growing season average temperature and precipitation. Although the general strengths and weaknesses of statistical models are widely understood, there has been little systematic evaluation of their performance relative to other methods. Here we use a perfect model approach to examine the ability of statistical models to predict yield responses to changes in mean temperature and precipitation, as simulated by a process-based crop model. The CERES-Maize model was first used to simulate historical maize yield variability at nearly 200 sites in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the impacts of hypothetical future scenarios of 2°C warming and 20% precipitation reduction. Statistical models of three types (time series, panel, and cross-sectional models) were then trained on the simulated historical variability and used to predict the responses to the future climate changes. The agreement between the process-based and statistical models’ predictions was then assessed as a measure of how well statistical models can capture crop responses to warming or precipitation changes. The performance of statistical models differed by climate variable and spatial scale, with time-series statistical models ably reproducing site-specific yield response to precipitation change, but performing less well for temperature responses. In contrast, statistical models that relied on information from multiple sites, namely panel and cross-sectional models, were better at predicting responses to temperature change than precipitation change. The models based on multiple sites were also much less sensitive to the length of historical period used for training. For all three statistical approaches, the performance improved when individual sites were first aggregated to country-level averages. Results suggest that statistical models, as compared to CERES-Maize, represent a useful if imperfect tool for projecting future yield responses, with their usefulness higher at broader spatial scales. It is also at these broader scales that climate projections are most available and reliable, and therefore statistical models are likely to continue to play an important role in anticipating future impacts of climate change.}

abstract = {Ongoing advances in satellite remote sensing data and machine learning methods have enabled crop yield estimation at various spatial and temporal resolutions. While yield mapping at broader scales (e.g., state or county level) has become common, mapping at finer scales (e.g., field or subfield) has been limited by the lack of ground truth data for model training and evaluation. Here we present a scale transfer framework, named Quantile loss Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (QDANN), that leverages knowledge from county-level datasets to map crop yields at the subfield level. Based on the strategy of unsupervised domain adaptation, QDANN is trained on labeled county-level data and unlabeled subfield-level data, with no requirement for yield information at the subfield level. We evaluate the proposed method applied to Landsat imagery and Gridmet weather data for maize, soybean, and winter wheat fields in the United States, using as reference data yield monitor records from roughly one million field-year observations. The model is compared with several process-based and machine learning-based benchmark approaches that train on simulated yield records or county-level data. QDANN-estimated yields achieved an R2 score (RMSE) of 48 % (2.29 t/ha), 32 % (0.85 t/ha), and 39 % (1.40 t/ha) for maize, soybean, and winter wheat in comparison with the ground-based yield measures, respectively. These performances are higher than benchmark approaches and are nearly as good as models trained on field-level data. When aggregated to the county level, the improvement achieved by QDANN is more pronounced and the R2 scores (RMSE) improved to 78 % (0.98 t/ha), 62 % (0.37 t/ha), and 53 % (1.00 t/ha) for maize, soybean, and winter wheat, respectively. This study demonstrates that the proposed scale transfer framework can serve as a reliable approach for yield mapping at the subfield level when there is no access to fine-scale yield information. Based on the QDANN model, we have generated and made publicly available 30-m annual yield maps for major crop-producing states in the U.S. since 2008.}

abstract = {Machine learning is an important decision support tool for crop yield prediction, including supporting decisions on what crops to grow and what to do during the growing season of the crops. Several machine learning algorithms have been applied to support crop yield prediction research. In this study, we performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to extract and synthesize the algorithms and features that have been used in crop yield prediction studies. Based on our search criteria, we retrieved 567 relevant studies from six electronic databases, of which we have selected 50 studies for further analysis using inclusion and exclusion criteria. We investigated these selected studies carefully, analyzed the methods and features used, and provided suggestions for further research. According to our analysis, the most used features are temperature, rainfall, and soil type, and the most applied algorithm is Artificial Neural Networks in these models. After this observation based on the analysis of machine learning-based 50 papers, we performed an additional search in electronic databases to identify deep learning-based studies, reached 30 deep learning-based papers, and extracted the applied deep learning algorithms. According to this additional analysis, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is the most widely used deep learning algorithm in these studies, and the other widely used deep learning algorithms are Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN).}

abstract = {The “Corn Belt” is a commonly used term, but often referenced as a vaguely defined region in the Midwest USA. A few key studies have delineated synoptic maps of the Corn Belt boundaries going back to the early 20th century, but a modern flexible and accessible framework for mapping the Corn Belt in space and time is needed. New tools provide reference maps for the Corn Belt in the 21st century and the ability to quantify space-time changes in corn cropping patterns. The Landuse and Agricultural Management Practices web-Service (LAMPS) was used to estimate the average corn (maize, Zea mays L.) area in each county of the contiguous 48 USA states for the years 2010–2016. LAMPS provides a modified areal Fraction of corn (Fc) used to map the Corn Belt at three intensity levels, for example. The resulting patterns illustrate a mostly contiguous Midwest Corn Belt surrounded by more scattered regions, including southern and eastern regions. We also mapped irrigated areas and temporal changes in Fc. Mapped patterns have the potential to help researchers study issues related to food, feed, biofuel, and water security.}

Premia calculations based on normal distributions and beta distributions are compared. The normal distribution over-states the probability of loss relative to the beta distribution, and causes premia to be higher. It is argued that use of the normal distribution in crop insurance premia calculation cannot be justified by appealing to a Central Limit Theorem because crop insurance loss events are not independent, and that distributions with flexible representation of skewness would be more appropriate for crop insurance premia calculation.},

abstract = {Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are increasingly used for discrete choice analysis. But, at present, it is unknown what sample size requirements are appropriate when using ANNs in this particular context. This paper fills this knowledge gap: we empirically establish a rule-of-thumb for ANN-based discrete choice analysis based on analyses of synthetic and real data. To investigate the effect of complexity of the data generating process on the minimum required sample size, we conduct extensive Monte Carlo analyses using a series of different model specifications with different levels of model complexity, including RUM and RRM models, with and without random taste parameters. Based on our analyses we advise to use a minimum sample size of fifty times the number of weights in the ANN; it should be noted, that the number of weights is generally much larger than the number of parameters in a discrete choice model. This rule-of-thumb is considerably more conservative than the rule-of-thumb that is most often used in the ANN community, which advises to use at least ten times the number of weights.}

	abstract  = "Crop yield is a highly complex trait determined by multiple
							 factors such as genotype, environment, and their interactions.
							 Accurate yield prediction requires fundamental understanding of
							 the functional relationship between yield and these interactive
							 factors, and to reveal such relationship requires both
							 comprehensive datasets and powerful algorithms. In the 2018
							 Syngenta Crop Challenge, Syngenta released several large
							 datasets that recorded the genotype and yield performances of
							 2,267 maize hybrids planted in 2,247 locations between 2008 and
							 2016 and asked participants to predict the yield performance in
							 2017. As one of the winning teams, we designed a deep neural
							 network (DNN) approach that took advantage of state-of-the-art
							 modeling and solution techniques. Our model was found to have a
							 superior prediction accuracy, with a root-mean-square-error
							 (RMSE) being 12\% of the average yield and 50\% of the standard
							 deviation for the validation dataset using predicted weather
							 data. With perfect weather data, the RMSE would be reduced to
							 11\% of the average yield and 46\% of the standard deviation. We
							 also performed feature selection based on the trained DNN model,
							 which successfully decreased the dimension of the input space
							 without significant drop in the prediction accuracy. Our
							 computational results suggested that this model significantly
							 outperformed other popular methods such as Lasso, shallow neural
							 networks (SNN), and regression tree (RT). The results also
							 revealed that environmental factors had a greater effect on the
