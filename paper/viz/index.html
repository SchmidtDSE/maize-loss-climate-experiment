                    <p>
                        <span class="emphasis">Climate change threatens the future of corn.</span> Studies expect planet-wide maize yields to drop by up to 24% by the end of this century (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00400-y" target="_blank">J√§germeyr et al. 2021</a>). Why might this happen? Climate change alters growing conditions (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03074-w">Williams et al 2024</a>) and can include a higher frequency and severity of stressful weather (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1633" target="_blank">Dai 2013</a>). Of course, all of this can impact farmer revenue (<a href="https://farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2023/07/extreme-heat-and-kansas-farm-income.html" target="_blank">Sajid et al 2023</a>). However, these changes can also challenge the institutions tasked with protecting and helping those growers (<a href="https://farmpolicynews.illinois.edu/2024/02/crop-insurance-costs-projected-to-jump-29/" target="_blank">Hanrahan 2024</a>).

                        <span class="emphasis">What might this future look like and how can we prepare for it?</span> This "explorable explanation" (<a href="http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/" target="_blank">Victor 2011</a>) walks you through an analysis of future maize yields from the perspective of one of these institutions: the US Federal Crop Insurance Program. This crucial resource for farmers and the broader US food system is increasingly threatened by climate change (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6989" target="_blank">Ray et al 2015</a>). In this online tool, we will go step by step to build and then play with artifical intelligence to understand how we might respond to these threats:

                        <ul>
                            <li>We will predict the probability and severity of maize loss within the <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/reference-maps/corn-belt" target="_blank">U.S. Corn Belt</a> (<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/reference-maps/corn-belt" target="_blank">NCEI</a>) by simulating the Multiple Peril Crop Insurance Program, "the oldest and most common form of federal crop insurance" (<a href="https://www.policyarchive.org/download/4403" target="_blank">Chite 2006</a>).</li>
                            <li>We will use those results to see how insurer risk will change under the Yield Protection (YP) plan. This covers farmers in the event of yield losses due to an insured cause (<a href="https://farms.extension.wisc.edu/articles/crop-insurance-policy-types/" target="_blank">Reuss</a>).</li>
                            <li>We will contrast those simulations to an alternative which imagines a future where climate change stops today. This will let us quantitatively highlight the insurer-relevant effects of climate change in the 2030 and 2050 timeframes.</li>
                            <li>We will use these data to design possible policy changes to help mitigate and enable adaptation to the specific climate-fueled risks we observe in our results.</li>
                        </ul>

                        You don't need to install any special software. We can do all of this from within your web browser! All that said, this online experience complements a more traditional <a href="">scientific paper (preprint)</a> which you may also review.

                            To understand this change, you can think of MPCI as using a mixture of different information to determine what price a grower pays for a certain amount of coverage (<a href="https://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/crops/html/a1-52.html" target="_blank">Plastina and Edwards 2020</a>). Generally, there's some information at the county-level but the APH for a farm being insured can change that price along with other adjustment and subsidies. Right now the horizontal axis that defines how much coverage a grower wants is defined in terms of a percent of APH but we will explore what happens if this is defined by <a href="ttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp" target="_blank">standard deviation</a> (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp" target="_blank">Hargrave 2024</a>) where this value is smaller the more stable a grower's yields are.

                            We will use a form of AI called a neural network. Modeled after how human brains work, there are different neurons connected to each other. Artifical neural networks in a computer have multiple layers of neurons that learn by example, changing the connections ("weights") between those neurons based on "training" data. For more information see the <a href="https://natureofcode.com/neural-networks/">Nature of Code</a> (<a href="https://natureofcode.com" target="_blank">Shiffman 2024</a>). Regardless, we will feed in information on historic growing conditions using data from a data product called CHC-CMIP6 (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03074-w">Williams et al 2024</a>) and the resulting maize yields as estimated by a model called SCYM (<a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0034425715001637" target="_blank">Lobell et al 2015</a>). Then, we will use climate projections from CHC-CMIP6 (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03074-w">Williams et al 2024</a>) to predict what future yields might look like. Finally, we will simulate the MPCI through a method called Monte Carlo (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/monte-carlo-simulation-a-practical-guide-85da45597f0e" target="_blank">Kwiatkowski 2022</a>).

                            To understand the impacts of climate change on agriculture, sophisticated predictive models build detailed projections from historic observations spanning many spatiotemporal variables. These crucial forecasts inform institutions such as government entities tasked with insuring grower livelihoods and supporting response to continued global warming. To help these decision makers engage these complex and often opaque predictive systems, our web-based open-source explorable explanation guides scientists, producers, policy makers, and other stakeholders through a data science pipeline in which an artificial neural network predicts future maize yields in the U.S. Corn Belt. Furthermore, after manipulating underlying assumptions and observing how changes impact model behavior, readers iteratively refine regulatory structures to confront a calamitous doubling in Yield Protection losses predicted at mid-century. Supported through game design principles of loop-based interaction and juxtaposition gratification, this experience not only explains AI mechanics and the specific shape of threats confronting the food system but also invites readers to experiment with different legal structures which may influence those outcomes. Altogether, supporting learning model mechanics before fostering play to refine regulation, these visualizations allow users to build understanding of crop insurance and predictive AI while supporting design of important policy structures needed for climate change adaptation.
