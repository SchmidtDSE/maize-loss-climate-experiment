                    <p>
                        <span class="emphasis">Climate change threatens the future of corn.</span> Studies expect planet-wide maize yields to drop by up to 24% by the end of this century (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00400-y" target="_blank">J√§germeyr et al. 2021</a>). Why? Climate change alters growing conditions (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03074-w">Williams et al 2024</a>), including a higher frequency and severity of stressful weather (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1633" target="_blank">Dai 2013</a>) which can impact yields (<a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0098847204000206" target="_blank">Sinsawat et al 2004</a>; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309186398_Effects_of_drought_stress_on_yield_and_yield_components_in_maize_cultivars_Zea_mays_L" target="_blank">Marouf et al 2013</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-020-00165-w" target="_blank">Lobell et al 2020</a>). Of course, these threats can impact farmer revenue (<a href="https://farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2023/07/extreme-heat-and-kansas-farm-income.html" target="_blank">Sajid et al 2023</a>). However, these changes can also challenge the institutions tasked with protecting and helping those growers (<a href="https://farmpolicynews.illinois.edu/2024/02/crop-insurance-costs-projected-to-jump-29/" target="_blank">Hanrahan 2024</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="emphasis">What might this future look like and how can we prepare for it?</span> This "explorable explanation" (<a href="http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/" target="_blank">Victor 2011</a>) walks through an analysis of future maize yields from the perspective of one of these important institutions: the US Federal Crop Insurance Program. This crucial resource for farmers and the broader US food system is increasingly threatened by climate change (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6989" target="_blank">Ray et al 2015</a>). In this online tool, we will go step by step through a machine learning / artifical intelligence model for this problem to understand and determine how we might respond to these threats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="emphasis">Here's an outline</span> of what we will explore:

                        <ul>
                            <li>We will predict the probability and severity of maize loss within the <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/reference-maps/corn-belt" target="_blank">U.S. Corn Belt</a> (<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/reference-maps/corn-belt" target="_blank">NCEI</a>) by simulating the Multiple Peril Crop Insurance Program, "the oldest and most common form of federal crop insurance" (<a href="https://www.policyarchive.org/download/4403" target="_blank">Chite et al 2005</a>).</li>
                            <li>We will use those results to see how insurer risk will change under the Yield Protection (YP) plan. This covers farmers in the event of yield losses due to an insured cause (<a href="https://farms.extension.wisc.edu/articles/crop-insurance-policy-types/" target="_blank">Reuss</a>).</li>
                            <li>We will contrast those simulations to an alternative which imagines a future where climate change stops today. This will let us quantitatively highlight the insurer-relevant effects of climate change in the 2030 and 2050 timeframes.</li>
                            <li>We will use these data to design possible policy changes to help mitigate and enable adaptation to the specific climate-fueled risks we observe in our results.</li>
                        </ul>

                        Our model will likely find that climate change will increase the rate at which farmers file insurance claims. However, we will also discover small tweaks to insurance formulas to include yield variance that could help mitigate these threats, benefitting both growers and insurers as they work to reduce the level of future crop loss and safeguard our food system.

                                        We will use a form of AI called a neural network. Modeled after how biological brains work, there are different neurons connected to each other in a network that learn over time.

                                        Artifical neural networks in a computer have multiple layers of neurons where, in our case, all neurons from one layer are connected to all the neurons in the following layer. The model learns by example: changing the connections between those neurons ("weights") based on "training" data. In other words, these models modify "neural pathways" based off of observing a series of inputs and their corresponding outputs.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We will dig into how we create these systems in the next step but the most important thing to understand is that we have a computer "learn" what types of outcomes are expected from what kinds of inputs by showing that system many examples in a "training" step. The challenge for the engineers and scientists constructing these models is figuring out how many neurons to use, in what structure, and how they should process examples. Regardless, this lets us estimate what future values might look like based on past observations.

                                        This modeling exercise is an example of dealing with unceratinty. In these kinds of systems, some variables have a range of values where sometimes all are equally likely and sometimes some in that range are more likely than others.

                                        Let's imagine that we are evaluating the following equation for cost to purchase corn where unit cost ("c") is typically $2 but can be any value between $1 and $5 depending on the market. Meanwhile, the number of units needed ("n") can be any value between 50 and 100 based on the demand which changes day to day. The challenge is figuring out what the expenditure on the corn will be ("e").
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="block-quote">
                                        e = c * n

                                        In our model, we simiarly predict a range of possibilities instead of a single value. To solve this problem, we use a method called Monte Carlo such that, in each simulation, we randomly choose a single value for each variable from among its range of possibilities. Some values may be more likely to be chosen than others based on how likely they are predicted to be. Anyway, this method then repeats that process many thousands of times to arrive at a distribution of outcomes.

This happens through four character geohashing, an algorithm that helps create these grids (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080305102941/http://blog.labix.org/2008/02/26/geohashorg-is-public/" target="_blank">Niemeyer 2008</a>). Every piece of land ends up in exactly one grid cell but there may be more land dedicated to growing maize in some areas versus others. Therefore, our model will give more weight to a cell which has more corn compared to a cell with less.

                        Input data goes in one side and comes out the other as a prediction in our neural network. In the middle, a series of layers transforms those data where all neurons from one layer connect to all of those in the next. This is the part of the network that changes as the model learns from examples, altering pathways between neurons.

                        The magic lies in helping the model understand if small fluctations in the data are real trends or just noise, a crucial task for which we have four tools:

                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="vocab">Depth</span>: The number of layers in the network (<a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-control-neural-network-model-capacity-with-nodes-and-layers/" target="_blank">Brownlee 2020</a>).

                            <li><span class="vocab">L2</span>: A penalty on the model for very deep pathways between neurons (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/regularization-in-deep-learning-l1-l2-and-dropout-377e75acc036" target="_blank">Oppermann 2020</a>). Conceptually, this avoids focusing too much on small specifics in the data unless there is strong evidence for that connection. Turning this "knob" higher sets a higher bar for the evidence required for those deep connections.</li>
                            <li><span class="vocab">Dropout</span>: Randomly turn off neurons while training (<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html" target="_blank">Srivastava et al 2014</a>). Conceptually, this encourages finding multiple ways to use inputs in making predictions and avoids relying on one small aspect of the data at risk of disrupting learning. This "knob" turned up means neurons are disabled with higher frequency.</li>
                            <li><span class="vocab">Blocks</span>: Sometimes certain data can be distracting to the model or simply having a large number of variables can become overwhelming (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/curse-of-dimensionality-a-curse-to-machine-learning-c122ee33bfeb" target="_blank">Karanam 2021</a>). This option lets us take out individual climate variables.</li>
                        </ul>

                        This first interactive lets us try out different depths, L2s, dropouts, and blocks. Clicking the "Try Model" button will test a new model where we split the historic data such that the network trains from one piece (called the "training set") before we grade it on the part it has not seen before (called the "validation set"), scoring performance with <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="This is a simple average of the error magnitude. In other words, it indicates, on average, how far off predictions from the network are from actuals regardless of if the model was too high or too low.">mean absolute error</span>. Our goal: go left on the horizontal axis (minimize error predicting <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="This is simply the average of the yields within the grid cell.">mean</span>) and to the bottom on the vertical axis (minimize error predicting <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="This is a measure of how wide the range of yields is expected to be in a grid cell (where we assume yields approximately follow a normal distribution within a grid cell).">std</span>).

                                    Optimizing the model requires a lot of experimentation. In general, we can follow some basic rules:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            A large distance between training set and validation set  <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Mean Absolute Error: this is a simple average of the error magnitude. In other words, it indicates, on average, how far off predictions from the network are from actuals regardless of if the model was too high or too low.">MAE</span> suggests the model pays too much attention to noise in the data (need to increase L2 / dropout or decrease depth).
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Error too far to the upper right suggests underfit and may have to increase depth or decrease dropout / L2.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    All that said, sometimes changing the parameters does not have the intended effect. Instead, data scientists building these models simply have to try a lot of different combinations.

                        It can be helpful to see how the neural network responds to different configurations. However, we can also ask a computer to optimize these metrics through a sweep where it tries different combinations of different parameters to try to find the best one (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/grid-search-for-model-tuning-3319b259367e" target="_blank">Joseph 2018</a>). Execute this by clicking / tapping the "Run Sweep" button.

                                    Even with a computer trying hundreds of models, we still have to make some choices:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Do we favor the model's ability to predict the <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="This is simply the average of the yields within the grid cell.">mean</span> equally with its ability to predict <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="This is a measure of how wide the range of yields is expected to be in a grid cell (where we assume yields approximately follow a normal distribution within a grid cell).">standard deviation</span>?

                                            After chosing a model configuration, we retrain with all available data so do we want to emphasize a model with the best metrics in the <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="The data witheld from model training used to compare candidates found during the model sweep.">validation set</span> or one that has just slightly worse performance but less <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="An overfit model has mistaken noise in the training examples as actual trends so may perform poorly when predicting outcomes for data it has not seen before.">overfit</span> so might do better with more examples to learn from?

                                            Do we want a <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="A deeper model contains more layers and more neurons.

                                    Sadly there is no one right answer but, in the selection we are using for the rest of this online lab, we prefer the ability to predict <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="This is simply the average of the yields within the grid cell.">mean</span> over <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Standard deviation: This is a measure of how wide the range of yields is expected to be in a grid cell (where we assume yields approximately follow a normal distribution within a grid cell).">std</span> by a ratio in weights of 3 to 1.

                        These data tell many different stories but consider a few different factors at play in these simulations:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span class="emphasis">Time</span>: Even though <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Actual Production History. For our purposes, this is the average of the last ten years of crop yields (FCIC 2020).">APHs</span> also change during this time in our simulation, in general things get worse in terms of losses as climate change progresses during the 2030 and then 2050 series.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="emphasis">Coverage levels</span>: The picture may look different for policies insuring 75% of yield versus 85% of yield due to the way that the edges of the distribution or "tails" are changing. Those insuring at higher levels see some very high claims rates under climate change.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="emphasis">Unit size</span>: The effects of climate change become less pronounced when simulating with the full <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="A set of fields which are insured together. This is sometimes also called a risk unit.">insured unit</span> where there may be more fields in a single policy compared to sub-unit which simulates closer to field-level. This is due to the "portfolio effect" where larger units offer more chances for high performing fields to offset fields with worse outcomes (<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/40647972" target="_blank">Knight et al 2024</a>).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="emphasis">Reference point</span>: Things look different depending on what we compare against. Constrating the continued climate change scenario (SSP245) to "historic" values in the recent past sees average yields stay about the same but the risk of loss increase. On the other hand, comparing to the "counterfactual" (a simulated future where climate change stops today) has our neural network actually expecting yields to increase relative to SSP245. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        Generally yields improve over time (<a href="https://www.agry.purdue.edu/ext/corn/news/timeless/yieldtrends.html" target="_blank">Nielsen 2023</a>) but climate change in our simulation wipes out most of the increases our neural network would otherwise expect if climate change stopped. This means that the average yield does not necessarily change dramatically from the historic <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Actual Production History. For our purposes, this is the average of the last ten years of crop yields (FCIC 2020).">APH</span> but the ends of the distribution of yield outcomes or "tails" evolve.

This specific pairing of unchanged average yields but higher volatility is at the center of the risk posed to crop insurance. That in mind, we will next explore possible policy adaptations.

                    <p>
                        In examining hypothetical growing histories, what kinds of behaviors do each type of APH (the current average-based vs a possible <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Standard deviation: this is a measure of how wide the range of yields is.">std</span>-based option) encourage? If an average-based approach encourages one to drive up the <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="This is simply the average, in this case of 10 years of crop yields.">mean</span> as high as possible, this alternative offers balance where increasing the average and stability both become beneficial. This recognizes the value that some growers offer the broader system in the form of resilience during difficult conditions.

                                Using recent data, the equivalent to insuring up to 25% below average is insuring up to 2.11 <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="This is a measure of how wide the range of yields is.">standard deviations</span> below average. As shown in the interactive, this would increase under further climate change and stability worsens. All that said, here is how this would get formulated:
                            
                                <ul>
                                    <li><span class="vocab">Average-based (current)</span>: loss = max(coverage percentage * average yield - actual yield, 0) </li>
                                    <li><span class="vocab">Std-based (proposed)</span>: loss = max(coverage standard deviations * average yield) / (yield standard deviation) - actual yield, 0)</li>
                                </ul>

                                Before moving on, there have been some issues of effectiveness of using crop insurance to encourage certain behaviors (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aepp.13206" target="_blank">Connor et al 2022</a>). This situation may not offer a silver bullet. However, this method offers unique flexibility. While could help provide insurance incentive for practices like regenerative agriculture, any change which offers stability gets reward similar to how any practice improving yields operate today. Agnostic options may offer a possible non-prescriptive systems change. 
                            </p>

                        Briefly recapping what we've done so far:

                        <ul>
                            <li>We <a href="#background" tab="background" class="advance-button">learned about crop insurance</a>, specifically <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Multi-Peril Crop Insurance.

                            <li>We <a href="#results" tab="results" class="advance-button">ran simulations</a> to discover that the loss (claims) rate will more than double at 2050 according to simulations.

Instead, the distribution "tails" change to show that yields will become less stable.</li>
                            <li>We <a href="#discussion" tab="discussion" class="advance-button">examined coverage formulas</a>. Since the current <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Actual Production History.

                        </ul>

                        Though important, this is just one of the stories these data can tell and this final interactive encourages you to explore others. Note that this refers to statistically <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Statistically significant means unlikely to have occurred by chance alone.">significant</span> results to cut through noise but, if desired, one can turn off that filter.

                            To understand the impacts of climate change on agriculture, sophisticated predictive models build detailed projections from historic observations spanning many spatiotemporal variables. These crucial forecasts inform institutions such as government entities tasked with insuring grower livelihoods and supporting response to continued global warming. To help these decision makers engage these complex and often opaque predictive systems, our web-based open-source explorable explanation guides scientists, producers, policy makers, and other stakeholders through a data science pipeline in which an artificial neural network predicts future maize yields in the U.S. Corn Belt. Furthermore, after manipulating underlying assumptions and observing how changes impact model behavior, readers iteratively refine regulatory structures to confront a calamitous doubling in Yield Protection losses predicted at mid-century. Supported through game design principles of loop-based interaction and juxtaposition gratification, this experience not only explains AI mechanics and the specific shape of threats confronting the food system but also invites readers to experiment with different legal structures which may influence those outcomes. Altogether, supporting learning model mechanics before fostering play to refine regulation, these visualizations allow users to build understanding of crop insurance and predictive AI while supporting design of important policy structures needed for climate change adaptation.
