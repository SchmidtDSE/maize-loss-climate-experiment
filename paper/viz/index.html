In short, our work anticipates that the probability of crop losses will rise such that, for the kind of insurance we examine, climate change will lead to a doubling in claims probability around 2050 relative to a future without further warming.

Every piece of land ends up in exactly one grid cell but there may be more land dedicated to growing maize in some areas versus others.

                                        Optimizing the model requires a lot of experimentation. In general, we can follow some basic rules:

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>

In other words, it indicates, on average, how far off predictions from the network are from actuals regardless of if the model was too high or too low.">MAE</span> suggests the model pays too much attention to noise in the data or is "overfit" and, in this case, need to increase L2 / dropout or decrease depth (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/overfitting-vs-underfitting-a-complete-example-d05dd7e19765" target="_blank">Koehrsen 2018</a>).
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Error too far to the upper right suggests "underfit" and may have to increase depth or decrease dropout / L2 (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/overfitting-vs-underfitting-a-complete-example-d05dd7e19765" target="_blank">Koehrsen 2018</a>).

                                        All that said, sometimes changing the parameters does not have the intended effect. Instead, data scientists building these models simply have to try a lot of different combinations of our hyper-parameters:

                                        <ul>

                            It can be helpful to see how the neural network responds to different configurations. However, we can also ask a computer to optimize these metrics through a sweep where it tries different combinations of different parameters to try to find the best one (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/grid-search-for-model-tuning-3319b259367e" target="_blank">Joseph 2018</a>). Execute this by clicking / tapping the "Run Sweep" button. For more details, see our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02217" target="_blank">scientific paper (preprint)</a>. We use that optimized configuration in the rest of this explorable explanation.

                                        Sadly there is no one right answer but, in the selection we are using for the rest of this online lab, we prefer the ability to predict <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="This is simply the average of the yields within the grid cell.">mean</span> over <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="In our case, this is a measure of how wide the range of yields are expected to be in a grid cell (where we assume yields approximately follow a normal distribution within a grid cell).">std</span> by a ratio in weights of 3 to 1.

                                        During the model sweep, we have to divide up our data into three different sets. In this process, we split the data by year.

                            These data tell many different stories but consider a few different factors at play in these simulations:

This is due to the "portfolio effect" where larger units offer more chances for high performing fields to offset fields with worse outcomes (<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/40647972" target="_blank">Knight et al 2024</a>).

                            Regardless, the simulations with further warming (SSP245) generally fare worse than those that expect current growing conditions to continue into the future.

                                        Due to the portfolio effect (where combining more fields together into an <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="A set of fields which are insured together in a policy. This is sometimes also called a risk unit.">insured unit</span> offers more opportunities for good outcomes in some fields to offset the negative outcomes in others), one of the more influential parameters on these results is unit size. In our Monte Carlo, we sample the actual unit size as reported by the Risk Management Agency (<a href="https://www.rma.usda.gov/SummaryOfBusiness/StateCountyCrop" target="_blank">RMA 2024</a>). However, in experiments where we either increase or decrease that size, this portfolio effect impacts both the climate change simulations and the counterfactual simulation without further warming. This means that the gap between the climate change and non-climate change simulations persists. This follow up result may suggest that these concerns remain regardless of how unit size may evolve.

                                        Before moving on, there have been some questions of the effectiveness of using crop insurance to encourage certain behaviors (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aepp.13206" target="_blank">Connor et al 2022</a>). To that end, note that this method offers unique flexibility: while it could help provide insurance incentive for practices like regenerative agriculture, any change which offers stability gets reward similar to how any practice improving yields operate today. Agnostic options may offer a possible non-prescriptive systems change and may address some prior concerns (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aepp.13206" target="_blank">Connor et al 2022</a>).

Deeper networks can learn more sophisticated lessons from the data but can require more data to train (<a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/much-training-data-required-machine-learning/" target="_blank">Brownlee 2019</a>) otherwise it may memorize examples instead of learning broader trends (<a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-control-neural-network-model-capacity-with-nodes-and-layers/" target="_blank">Brownlee 2020</a>).</dd>

Conceptually, this encourages finding multiple ways to use inputs in making predictions. This avoids relying on one small aspect of the data (though at the risk of disrupting learning). This "knob" turned up means neurons are disabled with higher frequency.</dd>

Longer geohashes mean smaller cells and, in the 4 character version, each cell is the size of about 28 by 20 kilometers (<a href="https://bhaugen.com/blog/geohash-sizes/" target="_blank">Haugen 2020</a>).</dd>

Conceptually, this avoids focusing too much on small specifics in the data unless there is strong evidence for that connection. Turning this "knob" up sets a higher bar for the evidence required for those deep connections.</dd>

                        <dt>Mean</dt>
                        <dd>This is simply the average like the average of the yields within the grid cell.</dd>
                        <dt>Mean Absolute Error</dt>
                        <dd>This is a simple average of the error magnitude. In other words, it indicates, on average, how far off predictions from the network are from actuals regardless of if the model was too high or too low. For example, if the model predicts that a neighborhood's yield will drop by 10% and it actually drops by 15%, the MAE would be 5%.

                        <dt>Overfit</dt>
                        <dd>An overfit model has mistaken noise in the training examples as actual trends so may perform poorly when predicting outcomes for data it has not seen before.

                        <dt>Portfolio Effect</dt>
                        <dd>In the context of this explorable, portfolio effect emerges where combining more fields together into an insured unit. This offers more opportunities for good outcomes in some fields to offset the negative outcomes in others. Our results find that increasing the size of the portfolio tends to decrease risk.
