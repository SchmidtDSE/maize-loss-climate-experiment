Climate change increasingly threatens this crucial resource for farmers and the broader US food system (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6989" target="_blank">Ray et al 2015</a>). In this online notebook, we will go step by step through a machine learning / artifical intelligence experiment predicting what might happen to the Yield Protection option within this program in the 2030 and 2050 timeframes. Specifically, we will use a series of small tools to build a neural network to understand this problem. After creating our model, we will then examine its predictions to determine how we might respond to these climate-driven threats.

Specifically, we will contrast simulations with climate change to those without further warming. This will let us quantitatively highlight the insurer-relevant effects of climate change in the 2030 and 2050 timeframes.</li>

                                        Our model will likely find that climate change will increase the rate at which farmers file insurance claims. However, we will also discover small tweaks to insurance formulas to include yield variance that could help mitigate these threats, benefitting both growers and insurers as they work to reduce the level of future crop loss and safeguard our food system.

In other words, these models modify "neural pathways" based off of observing a series of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Meanwhile, the number of units needed ("n") can be any value between 50 and 100 based on the demand which changes day to day. The challenge is figuring out what the expenditure on the corn will be ("e").

To solve this problem, we use a method called Monte Carlo such that, in each simulation, we randomly choose a single value for each variable from among its range of possibilities. Some values may be more likely to be chosen than others based on how likely they are predicted to be. Anyway, this method then repeats that process many thousands of times to arrive at a distribution of outcomes.

                            Input data goes in one side and comes out the other as a prediction in our neural network. In the middle, a series of layers transforms those data where all neurons from one layer connect to all of those in the next. This is the part of the network that changes as the model learns from examples, altering pathways between neurons.

                            The magic lies in helping the model understand if small fluctations in the data are real trends or just noise, a crucial task for which we have four tools:

                            <ul>

Conceptually, this avoids focusing too much on small specifics in the data unless there is strong evidence for that connection. Turning this "knob" up sets a higher bar for the evidence required for those deep connections.</li>
                                <li><span class="vocab">Dropout</span>: Randomly turn off neurons while training (<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html" target="_blank">Srivastava et al 2014</a>). Conceptually, this encourages finding multiple ways to use inputs in making predictions. This avoids relying on one small aspect of the data (though at the risk of disrupting learning). This "knob" turned up means neurons are disabled with higher frequency.</li>
                                <li><span class="vocab">Blocks</span>: Sometimes certain data can be distracting to the model or simply having a large number of variables can become overwhelming (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/curse-of-dimensionality-a-curse-to-machine-learning-c122ee33bfeb" target="_blank">Karanam 2021</a>). This option lets us take out individual climate variables.</li>

                            This interactive lets us try out different depths, L2s, dropouts, and blocks. Clicking the "Try Model" button will test a new model where we split the historic data such that the network trains from one piece (called the "training set") before we grade it on the part it has not seen before (called the "validation set"). We score performance with <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="This is a simple average of the error magnitude.

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                A large distance between training set and validation set <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Mean Absolute Error: this is a simple average of the error magnitude. In other words, it indicates, on average, how far off predictions from the network are from actuals regardless of if the model was too high or too low.">MAE</span> suggests the model pays too much attention to noise in the data or is "overfit" and, in this case, need to increase L2 / dropout or decrease depth (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/overfitting-vs-underfitting-a-complete-example-d05dd7e19765" target="_blank">Koehrsen 2018</a>).
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Error too far to the upper right suggests "underfit" and may have to increase depth or decrease dropout / L2 (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/overfitting-vs-underfitting-a-complete-example-d05dd7e19765" target="_blank">Koehrsen 2018</a>).
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                        All that said, sometimes changing the parameters does not have the intended effect. Instead, data scientists building these models simply have to try a lot of different combinations.

                            It can be helpful to see how the neural network responds to different configurations. However, we can also ask a computer to optimize these metrics through a sweep where it tries different combinations of different parameters to try to find the best one (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/grid-search-for-model-tuning-3319b259367e" target="_blank">Joseph 2018</a>). Execute this by clicking / tapping the "Run Sweep" button. For more details, see our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02217" target="_blank">scientific paper (preprint)</a>.

                                        Even with a computer trying hundreds of models, we still have to make some choices:

                                            <li>
                                                Do we favor the model's ability to predict the <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="This is simply the average of the yields within the grid cell.">mean</span> equally with its ability to predict <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="This is a measure of how wide the range of yields are expected to be in a grid cell (where we assume yields approximately follow a normal distribution within a grid cell).">standard deviation</span>?

                                                After chosing a model configuration, we retrain with all available data so do we want to emphasize a model with the best metrics in the <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="The data witheld from model training used to compare candidates found during the model sweep.">validation set</span> or one that has just slightly worse performance but less <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="An overfit model has mistaken noise in the training examples as actual trends so may perform poorly when predicting outcomes for data it has not seen before.">overfit</span> so might do better with more examples to learn from?

                                                Do we want a <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="A deeper model contains more layers and more neurons.

                                        Sadly there is no one right answer but, in the selection we are using for the rest of this online lab, we prefer the ability to predict <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="This is simply the average of the yields within the grid cell.">mean</span> over <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Standard deviation: This is a measure of how wide the range of yields are expected to be in a grid cell (where we assume yields approximately follow a normal distribution within a grid cell).">std</span> by a ratio in weights of 3 to 1.

                                        During the model sweep, we have to divide up our data into three different sets.

                                <li>
                                    <span class="emphasis">Coverage levels</span>: The picture may look different for policies insuring 75% of yield versus 85% of yield due to the way that the edges of the distribution or "tails" are changing. Those insuring at higher levels see some very high claims rates under climate change.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="emphasis">Reference point</span>: Things look different depending on what we compare against. Constrating the continued climate change scenario (SSP245) to "historic" values in the recent past sees average yields stay about the same but the risk of loss increase. On the other hand, comparing to the "counterfactual" (a simulated future where climate change stops today) has our neural network actually expecting yields to increase relative to SSP245. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="emphasis">Unit size</span>: The effects of climate change become less pronounced when simulating with the full <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="A set of fields which are insured together.

This is due to the "portfolio effect" where larger units offer more chances for high performing fields to offset fields with worse outcomes (<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/40647972" target="_blank">Knight et al 2024</a>).

                            In looking at how these variables influence the results, notice that the claims rate increases in all cases when looking to the simulations with further climate change but the specific size of that change may depend on some of these parameters.

In our Monte Carlo, we sample the actual unit size as reported by the Risk Management Agency (<a href="https://www.rma.usda.gov/SummaryOfBusiness/StateCountyCrop" target="_blank">RMA 2024</a>). However, in experiments where we either increase or decrease that size, this portfolio effect impacts both the climate change simulations and the counterfactual simulation without further warming. This means that the gap between the climate change and non-climate change simulations persists. This follow up result may suggest that these concerns remain regardless of how unit size may evolve.

                                        Before moving on, there have been some questions of the effectiveness of using crop insurance to encourage certain behaviors (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aepp.13206" target="_blank">Connor et al 2022</a>). To that end, note that this method offers unique flexibility: while it could help provide insurance incentive for practices like regenerative agriculture, any change which offers stability gets reward similar to how any practice improving yields operate today. Agnostic options may offer a possible non-prescriptive systems change and may address some prior concerns (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aepp.13206" target="_blank">Connor et al 2022</a>).

                            Briefly recapping what we've done so far:

                            <ul>
                                <li>We <a href="#background" tab="background" class="advance-button">learned about crop insurance</a>, specifically <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Multi-Peril Crop Insurance.

                                <li>We <a href="#results" tab="results" class="advance-button">ran simulations</a> to discover that the loss (claims) rate will more than double at 2050 according to our work. After wiping out yield improvements which would have happend otherwise, climate change leaves average yields relatively unchanged. Instead, the distribution "tails" change to show that yields will become less stable.</li>
                                <li>We <a href="#discussion" tab="discussion" class="advance-button">examined coverage formulas</a>. In this section we explored how the current <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Actual Production History.

However, we also explored how incorporating variance into coverage formulas may help.</li>
                            </ul>

                            Though important, this is just one of the stories these data can tell and this final interactive encourages you to explore others. Note that this refers to statistically <span tabindex="0" class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Statistically significant means unlikely to have occurred by chance alone.">significant</span> results to cut through noise but, if desired, one can turn off that filter.

                                        To understand the impacts of climate change on agriculture, predictive models use data on growing conditions and yields in order to build detailed risk projections. These crucial forecasts inform institutions such as government entities tasked with insuring grower livelihoods and supporting response to continued global warming. We specifically focus on one of these important food system actors: the US Federal Crop Insurance Program. To help decision makers engage the sophisticated and sometimes opaque modeling methods needed within the complexities of the crop insurance system, our web-based open source explorable explanation guides scientists, producers, policy makers, and other stakeholders through a data science pipeline in which an artificial neural network predicts future maize yields in the U.S. Corn Belt and shows how those forecasts would impact insurer-relevant metrics. Furthermore, after manipulating underlying assumptions, readers consider regulatory changes to confront a calamitous doubling in Yield Protection losses predicted at mid-century. Supported through game design principles of loop-based interaction and juxtaposition gratification, this experience not only explains AI mechanics and the specific shape of threats confronting the food system but also invites readers to experiment with different legal structures which may influence or help guard against those predicted negative outcomes. Altogether, supporting learning model mechanics before fostering play to refine regulation, these visualizations allow users to build understanding of crop insurance and predictive AI while using this modeling to support design of important policy structures needed for climate change adaptation. These subtle but essential changes could help both insurers and producers encourage risk-reducing strategies such as regenerative agriculture.
