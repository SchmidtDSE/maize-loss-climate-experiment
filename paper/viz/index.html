                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                90 million acres across the US grows corn, a massive amount of farmland not only critically serving the domestic food system but also <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="10 to 20% of US corn crop are typically exported annually (Ates 2023)." tabindex="0">the rest of the world</span> (<a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/corn-and-other-feed-grains/feed-grains-sector-at-a-glance/" target="_blank">Ates 2023</a>). Like agriculture more broadly, climate change threatens this essential crop (<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3124/global-climate-change-impact-on-crops-expected-within-10-years-nasa-study-finds/" target="_blank">Gray 2021</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00400-y" target="_blank">Jagermeyr et al 2021</a>) but, while tools exist for growers to adapt to these anticipated threats, this paper considers structural financial barriers to their adoption.

                    This study projects future climate risk and adaptation potential through institution-relevant metrics to accomplish three goals:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Policy makers are experts who must craft regulation by conversing with data directly using their own knowledge <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11359" target="_blank">Pottinger et al 2023</a>) but the literature's necessarily complex methods are often opaque and published in static media that inhibit this "dialogue" and tell "the author's argument, and nothing else" (<a href="http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/" target="_blank">Victor 2011</a>).</li>
                        <li>Though modeling often focuses on overall productivity (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00400-y" target="_blank">Jagermeyr et al 2021</a>), insurers and regulators need statistically significant significant metrics regarding policy-relevant loss events in order to quanitfy benefits (<a href="https://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/crops/html/a1-44.html" target="_blank">Plastina and Johnson 2022</a>).</li>
                        <li>Complementing prior work disecting individual threats and practices (<a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2590332220300889" target="_blank">Bowles et al 2020</a>), this study considers multi-year climate simulations to attempt to reach closer towards more a necessary comprehensive understanding of "the full extent in production risk increases due to [climate] changes" (<a href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/3_FPAC_RMA_ClimateAdaptationPlan_2022.pdf" target="_blank">RMA 2022</a>).
                    </ul>

                    To offer this agency, relevance, and comprehensiveness, this study provides configurable interactive multi-year visualizations of insurer-relevant metrics.

                <h2>Discussion</h2>
                This dual observation of stable average yields punctuated by potentially more severe losses may indicate a threat to the US food system and financial health of its crop insurance program, highlighting the need to leverage the adaptation potential highlighted by this study. However, before understanding those practical implications further in the Conclusion Section, discussion first turns to key parameters, future work, and design.

                    Results remain sensitive to geohash size and loss event threshold. First, though this paper focuses on the MPCI 25% catastrophic loss, different insurance products may consider others as afforded by this work. Second, 4 character geohashes afford strong performance but additional work may consider more granular predictions.

                Simulations see a volatile future needing to shift perspective from yield average to stability where the former moves little while the later probability of catastrophic events moves substantially. Presenting a particular challenge to both the food system and the financial structures supporting it: measures of baseline yields such as the USDA APH (<a href="https://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/crops/html/a1-56.html" target="_blank">Plastina and Edwards 2014</a>) which use averages to manage risk may not change dramatically even as climate change increases the actual probability of loss each year, highlighting climate change's "silent" structural challenge in the food system and the financial solvency of insurance.
