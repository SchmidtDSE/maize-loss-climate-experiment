                <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                This application records standard server access logs for security and stability reasons, including to prevent abuse. This is a common practice employed by many websites necessary for maintaing application function. This information includes:

                <ul>
                    <li>IP addresses which describe from which location and internet connection the application is accessed.</li>
                    <li>User agent strings which provide basic information about the device and software ("browser") used to access the site.</li>
                    <li>The requested URLs which are unique identifiers for data and other resources requested from our servers.</li>
                </ul>

                These logs are maintained for security reasons and to ensure strong application performance but are anonymized within 7 days of collection. These anonymized statistics are maintained indefinently as aggregated information for us to understand usage patterns in order to improve the service and maintain its performance. The anonymized data may also include error or bug reports. That said, and no other presonal identifying information is collected including email address, phone number, race, ethnicity, age, etc. Furthermore, please note that:

                    </li><li>IP address is not retained past 7 days except for security / abuse prevention purposes if potential unusual behavior is deteced like in the case of a large number of requests.</li>
                    <li>No information we collect is used for advertising.</li>
                    <li>Though we do not ask users their age to respect their privacy, this webpage is intended for those 18 years and older.</li>

                <h3>Data Storage</h3>
                We save very limited data to your device and that data is not used to track you.
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Cookies are small text files saved to your computer to maintain data such as preferences between website sessions. This application uses essential cookies to support the core function of the application to, for example, prevent showing explanatory text multiple times and improve user experience. These cookies are required by the application to function.</li>

                    <li>Some browsers may save temporary copies of our data and code for performance reasons through a process called "caching" which can be controlled through your browser settings. This application may use "cache-busters" to inform your browser when new versions of application resources are available.</li>
                    <li>Local storage is used, for example, to save the application on your computer to support weak internet connections or offline usage. This includes the local storage of the Progressive Web Application if enabled and supported. Other use of local storage is optional in specific application features but is engaged only after your confirmation. For example, an optional additional use of local storage includes saving and loading policy scenarios.</li>
